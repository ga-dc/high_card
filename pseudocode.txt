build deck using map?
full_deck = suits(4) { ranks(13) }
puts full_deck

Maybe map each number card to suits, then map suits to a complete deck?

def build_suits
  13.times do |n|
  full_suits[n] << ranks[n]
  end

  getting players:

  while input != "play"
  puts "input player name"
  gets player[i]
  i += 1
  end
