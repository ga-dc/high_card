#Build a deck of shuffled cards.

#The deck should be an array of cards.
#Each card should be a mini-array with a value and suit. Example: [8, "hearts"]
#Shuffle the deck. It would look something like this...
#deck = [
#    [8, "hearts"],
#    [2, "diamonds"],
#    ["J", "clubs"],
#    ...
#]
#NOTE: do not hardcode the deck. Create it by performing methods on the two arrays in the starter code.
#Collect an array of player names by prompting:

#{}"{n} players so far. Enter a player name, or type 'play':"
#Upon "play", deal each player a card.
#Find the highest card score dealt (Aces high).
#Find the winning player name, then print out:
#{}"Winner(s): {name1, name2, â€¦}!"
