    #Build a deck of shuffled cards.

    #The deck should be an array of cards.
    #Each card should be a mini-array with a value and suit. Example: [8, "hearts"]
    #Shuffle the deck. It would look something like this...
    #deck = [
    #    [8, "hearts"],
    #    [2, "diamonds"],
    #    ["J", "clubs"],
    #    ...
    #]
    #NOTE: do not hardcode the deck. Create it by performing methods on the two arrays in the starter code.
    #Collect an array of player names by prompting:

    #{}"{n} players so far. Enter a player name, or type 'play':"
    #Upon "play", deal each player a card.
    #Find the highest card score dealt (Aces high).
    #Find the winning player name, then print out:
    #{}"Winner(s): {name1, name2, â€¦}!"
